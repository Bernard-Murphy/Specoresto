Specoresto is an app that takes your location (if you allow it), and finds restaurants close by that cater to people with special dietary needs. There are two options as of now: gluten free and vegan. More can be added upon request. Click one of the options and it will find the 20 closest restaurants with the criteria that you selected. The restaurants shown will have their name, address, phone number, rating, a link to the reviews page, and usually a relative price range. Specoresto utilizes Yelp's API.
